Credits: I have used the example from `react-native-snap-carousel` since I wanted to finish the app within a day and not build animations.

This is an app that I made as a freelance mobile app developer for a firm in Qatar. The design is not mine (I would never approve of it), it has been copied from their existing android app named QShoow.

I have used this opportunity to create a boilerplate app for anyone looking to create a media showcase/library featured application. Please note that even though there are 'buy' buttons in the app, they will not be working on this boilerplate since there is no merchant info.
